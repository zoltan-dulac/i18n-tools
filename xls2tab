# xls2tab - a BASH script that will take
# a Excel file and converts it to a UTF-8 tab delimited
# file.  This was created so this funcitonality can be 
# used by shell scripts, as well as the fact that 
# Microsoft Office has a huge problem with saving stuff
# into UTF-8 tab delimited files.
#
# Dependencies:
# - LibreOffice
#   http://libreoffice.org
#
# This script has been tested under OSX and Microsoft 
# Windows using Cygwin.  It should work using Linux with
# no modifications (please email me at 
# zoltan.dulac@gmail.com if there are any issues).
#
# Latest version can be grabbed from github at:
# https://github.com/zoltan-dulac/i18n-tools
