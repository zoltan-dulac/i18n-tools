ABOUT THIS DIRECTORY
====================

The versions of ascii2uni and uni2ascii were compiled
with Cygwin and will only work with Cygwin installed.

They are included here because as of September 26, 2015,
the offical version does not compile under Cygwin out
of the box.  In order to get it to work, I did the following:

1) Downloaded the latest version of uni2ascii at:
   http://billposer.org/Software/uni2ascii.html
   
2) I ran the configure script, as per the instructions in
   uni2ascii's instructions
   
3) I made a small change to the Makefile, changing the line
   that reads:
   
   LIBS = 

   to
   
   LIBS =  -lintl

4) I then compiled the application using the 'make' command.

I have sent a bug report to the original author of uni2ascii.
Hopefully, this issue will be resolved correctly in the 
official source code.
